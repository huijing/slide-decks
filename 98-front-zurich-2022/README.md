# The many flavours of enterprise CSS grid

*For Front Conference Zurich 2022. This is a sort-of transcript plus my notes for the talk.*

Hello everyone! This is the first conference I'm speaking at since COVID happened so it does feel kind of surreal. I'm very happy to be here and grateful to the organisers for giving me the opportunity to talk to all of you about my favourite topic in the world, CSS.

We're at a frontend conference today, right? So I'm going to assume a lot of us are in the business of how displaying web content on a digital screen. Which could be of any and all sizes. For the next half an hour, we're going to think about, more specifically, the laying out of content these screens.

If your content is going to be rendered by a browser engine, then your main mode of communication with the browser for styling content has to be CSS. And I'm sure everyone today has their own opinion about CSS, some of you might love it as much as I do, while others might see of it as a hard-to-deal with API you would like to avoid as much as possible.

Regardless of your opinions on CSS, I'm not here to tell you what to think or how to feel. The reality is that browser engines today are much more capable than before, they can lay out content much better than before. And we need to know how to make full use of the browser's web layout capabilities.

Technology evolves very fast, I know, but as of now, most web interactions involve a screen. And these screens can be as small as a watch-face or as large as a 70-inch super HDTV. And you, the developer or designer or creator, can't really control this.
