    <title>East Asian web typography: crossing cultural boundaries for web layout inspiration</title>
    <meta name="description" content="This talk traces the parallel history of western and eastern typography from handwriting to the internet age, setting the context for how the web is a brand new medium for typesetting. CSS allows us to implement advanced typographic features and multi-directional layouts, that not only benefits internationalisation, but opens up a myriad of options for creative and interesting layouts in general as well.">

            <p>Tere päevast! Welcome back to the front-end track. Before lunch, we covered the architectural side of things with Asim, as well as some functional programming concepts applied to Javascript with Milosz.</p>
            <p>And now, I'm going to talking a bit about the CSS side of things, which affects how your content looks like to your users. We'll be touching on CSS at the typography level, as well as the layout level.</p>
            <p>But before I begin, can I have a show of hands if anyone in the audience speaks any East Asian languages, like Chinese or Japanese?</p>

              <p>So let's get into it. What do you think about when you hear the word typography? Do you think about fancy letters and elaborate typefaces? Is typography a niche topic something only artsy, creative types care about?</p>
              <p>Perhaps. But typography has made its way into mainstream news recently as well. Largely because big brand names like Netflix and National Geographic did a lot of marketing around their font redesigns.</p>
              <p>There was also that Supreme Court case in Pakistan where the Microsoft font, Calibri, was the crucial piece of evidence that proved the forgery of financial documents.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>So that's all quite interesting, but what exactly is typography? You can find lots of definitions out there, but personally, I've settled on this one by Gerrit Noordzij.</p>
              <p>Typography is writing with prefabricated letters. Letters are a type of grapheme, which is the smallest unit of a writing system of any given language.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Chinese typefaces are extremely challenging to create, simply due to the volume of glyphs required. The average number of glyphs for a Chinese system font clocks in at around 35,000 glyphs, give or take a couple thousand.</p>
              <p>This quote is from an article on Quartz that covered the process of creating a Chinese font, and it's a pretty interesting read, which goes into how much effort is needed to design and create a Chinese typeface.</p>
              <p>For a typeface to be viably used as body copy, it will probably need a minimum coverage of around 7000 glyphs for simplified Chinese or around 13,000 for traditional Chinese. That's still a lot of glyphs, hence Chinese fonts are almost always designed by teams over a period of years.</p>

              <p>But why do we have so many different font formats anyway? Time for a bit of history. The earliest fonts were pixel-based bitmaps, which didn't work out so well when it came to high-resolution printing.</p>
              <p>A lot of smart people worked on this problem. And one of the solutions came from Adobe founder, John Warnock. He created Postscript in 1985, the very first vector font, and it really took off.</p>
              <p>TrueType was Apple and Microsoft's answer to Adobe's font monopoly. Microsoft came up with TrueType Open in 1994 and eventually Adobe joined in and together they developed OpenType.</p>
              <p>Microsoft also came up with EOT or embedded OpenType, a proprietary format for use on web pages. Although they tried to submit this as a W3C recommendation, it was rejected in favour of WOFF, or the Web Open Font Format. WOFF2 is an improvement over WOFF with significantly better compression rates.</p>

              <p>On the practical side of things, we use the <code>@font-face</code> rule to declare a list of different font formats for browser support but nowadays, it's safe enough to declare just WOFF and WOFF2.</p>

              <p>Then we have the <code>unicode-range</code> descriptor. which allows us to create composite fonts that mix glyphs from different fonts for different scripts.</p>

              <p>I have this habit of subsetting my webfonts rather aggressively, and usually I stick with the Basic Latin character set, which does not include any of the letters with diacritics. So those letters got rendered with the fallback font.</p>
              <p>Sometimes I see that the fallback font is being rendered from the fonts panel, but can't figure out which characters I missed out. With the font highlighter tool, I can see exactly which characters are using which fonts.</p>
              <p>All these font descriptors I've talked about thus far look very similar to CSS properties, but they are 2 completely different things.</p>

            <aside class="notes">I learned the difference between the 2 after watching Chris Lilley, who chaired the group that developed @font-face, explain it during his dotCSS talk. That properties are requests for styling and descriptors are descriptions of capabilities. A <code>font-weight: bold;</code> within a <code>@font-face</code> rule means this font can do bold. While a <code>font-weight: bold;</code> applied as a property means style this element with a font that can do bold.</aside>

              <p>CSS font properties are our typesetting tools for the web. When you use them in your CSS declarations, imagine that you're running your own printing workshop. And you're telling your apprentice, in this case, the browser, that you need a font which is a particular size, style, weight and so on.</p>
              <p>Your apprentice then runs off to the back room, where all the fonts are kept, and tries to find the font that best matches your instructions based on their descriptors, which were assigned in the @font-face rule.</p>
              <p>Let's look at one which isn't that commonly used at the moment, <code>font-synthesis</code>.</p>

              <p>Now, your smart apprentice can sometimes be too well-meaning. Sometimes the true italic or heavier version of a font does not exist, so the browser will try to create that effect by itself, based on a regular font.</p>
              <p>Most Chinese fonts don't have italic variants. We can set the <code>font-synthesis</code> property to a value of <code>none</code>, to tell the browser to just leave the font alone.</p>

              <p>A variable font is the equivalent of multiple individual fonts, compactly packaged within a single font file, which can potentially be a big plus when it comes to performance. And is especially significant for fonts with large glyph sets, like CJK fonts.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Laying out content in a different direction does require a change in perspective. And I gleaned quite a few insights from working with vertical layout. For example, the techniques I was so used to for centring items worked a bit differently with a vertical layout.</p>
              <p>To vertically centre a block, setting the top and bottom margins to <code>auto</code> actually does work, unlike in horizontal writing, which is great. But trying to centre something horizontally is a pretty painful experience.</p>

              <p style="font-size:75%;text-align:left;height:75vh">A vital part of New York’s avant-garde art scene from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, Yayoi Kusama developed a distinctive style utilizing approaches associated with Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism, Pop art, Feminist art, and Institutional Critique—but she always defined herself in her own terms. “I am an obsessional artist,” she once said. “People may call me otherwise, but…I consider myself a heretic of the art world.”</p>
              <p style="font-size:75%;text-align:left;height:75vh">Kusama was born in 1929 into a well-off but dysfunctional family in Nagano, Japan. Largely shielded from the horrors of World War II, she was, as she has claimed, nevertheless scarred by her mother’s cruelty, her father’s infidelities, and her family’s discouragement of her interest in art making. She started painting at the age of 10 when she began experiencing the visual and aural hallucinations that would plague her, while also fueling her creativity, for the rest of her life. She has maintained that her “artwork is an expression of my life, particularly of my mental disease.”</p>

              <p>It's so much easier to get enthusiastic about new CSS features these days because they ship and become widely supported so much quicker now. And the same goes for bug fixes.</p>
              <p>Every major browser engine has a pretty open process for raising bugs, and raising bugs for a particular feature sends a signal to browser vendors that developers want to use this feature. This encourages them to prioritise related bug fixes.</p>
              <p>It's a win for everyone. By taking the time to submit a bug report, you gain karma points, get your bugs fixed AND make the web better for all of us. By the way, that flexbox bug I showed? It got fixed in the next release. Just saying.</p>

            <p>I just want to wrap up by saying, the thing about attending conferences, at least for me, is not so much to gain expertise overnight, but rather to get inspired. To learn of things that I did not know existed, to discover something new and perhaps gain insights and hear perspectives that never occurred to me before.</p>
            <p>So maybe for some of you, these techniques fit your use-case and you can go home and use them tomorrow, that's great. But even if they don't, that's fine too. Knowing what the web is capable of, and what you can potentially build with it, is the act of growing your web design toolbox.</p>
