            <p>And also, to each and every one of you, you have no idea how much we appreciate you for choosing to spend your Wednesday afternoon with us. 3pm probably wasn't our best decision, but hey, you're all here now.

            <p>There was something called the Browser Wars, when browsers competed by adding non-standard features and extensions to the fledgeling HTML, CSS and Javascript syntax. I did not fight in said war, I was merely part of what was being fought over.</p> 
            <p>In fact, when I got my first “real” job as a web developer, fixed layouts were already falling out of favour, and responsive design was the norm. That was great, because when it came to web design, I developed a mental model of the web that was dynamic from the get-go. I didn't really have to overhaul my way of thinking when designing for the web.</p>

            <p>But jokes aside, in my mind, the web is a dynamic and interactive medium. And it was upon learning more about browsers’ layout engines, how rendering works and their relationship with HTML and CSS that has shaped my current opinion of web design.</p>

            <p>Perhaps you may not agree with me, but I do believe that an understanding of the history of the web, amongst many other things, is essential to becoming a better web designer. Let’s be honest, the digital age we live in now moves at a break-neck speed. The first electronic computers came about in the 1940s, that’s less than a century ago.
            <p>Which is why I think it is important for us to understand how the web came to be in its current state today. To give us a greater sense of appreciation of what we have right now, and inform a direction of where we ought to be going, moving forward.</p>

            <p>This concept of cross-referencing information within documents could allow for a “web” of information to be held electronically on machines across the world, via some form of hypertext.</p>
            <p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee is credited with inventing the World Wide Web because he developed the language for encoding documents (<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>), the protocol for linking them (<abbr title="" itle="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>) and the method of addressing them (<abbr title="Universal Resource Locator">URL</abbr>).

          <aside class="notes"> 
            <p>The story of CSS started in 1994. You see, the web started to become more popular as a publication medium, but there was no good way to style documents at the time. Håkon Wium Lie saw a need to have a stylesheet language for the web, and presented his proposal for CSS at the 2nd International World Wide Web conference in Chicago.</p>
            <p>Stylesheets in browsers were not a new idea, as separation of document structure from presentation had been a goal of HTML since the beginning. Sir Tim Berners-Lee wrote his NeXT browser/editor to support use of a simple style sheet to determine document styles.</p>
            <p>But he decided to let browsers decide for themselves how to best display pages to their users. A very laissez-faire approach. So users of the web did what users do best. Complain. Largely about how they couldn't control how their pages looked.</p>

            <p>In his words, the idea was to make something that Web designers, i.e. people who may or may not have much programming training, could use to add a little bit of animation or a little bit of smarts to their Web forms and their Web pages.</p>
            <p>So in 1996, JavaScript was implemented in Netscape first, then Internet Explorer. Fun fact, the IE version was actually called JScript, because trademarks.</p>

            <p>Some of you might be thinking, but browsers are still broken, right? I'm going to make the assumption that a number of people in this room have had the experience of building a comp in one browser that works great, only to find that it's rendering weird in another one (one that you obviously did not test at all during the build process).</p>
            <p>What we need to understand is that browsers are software, software that is built by human engineers, working for different companies. Each of these companies have their own internal dynamics and decision-making matrices that outsiders like us are simply not privy to. So no, features will not be universally supported all at the same time.</p>
            <p>But because of web standards, they will get there.</p>

            <p>New layout techniques like Flexbox and CSS grid give us a whole suite of commands to tell the browser how we’d like things to look depending on the context of the screen being used. And it’s much easier to trust the browser if we understand how it works.</p>

            <p>As builders for the web, we need to adapt to the evergreen browser model where features and bug fixes get shipped rapidly, so we layer on different styles and looks that are not browser-specific, but rather, feature-specific.</p>
            <p>Feature queries are a fantastic addition to our toolbox, because they allow us to perform this layering natively, without resorting to extraneous code libraries. If you had to write extra code to make the website look exactly the same on every browser, you could write less code and have designs that work well on browsers with different levels of feature support.</p>
            <p>I've come to the realisation that designing layouts on the web requires interpolative thinking, on multiple levels. We don't just think in one fixed dimension, we get to think about how our design will morph on a narrow screen, or on an older browser, in addition to how it will appear on a browser with the latest features.</p>
            <p>There is no other medium that let's us do this. How great is that? To me, our medium is really something special.</p>

            <p>I reuse this example all the time, so maybe you've already seen this before, but the point I'm trying to make here is that, we need to move away from the idea that a site or page needs to look the same on every browser.</p>
            <p>CSS shapes is one of my favourite properties. You know I'm a CSS nerd because I actually can rank CSS properties based on personal preference. But anyway, CSS shapes is one of those properties with rather uneven support. And hence a great candidate for feature queries.</p>
            <p>IE11, and any older browser that does not support feature queries, will still get styled, so the content can be comfortably consumed. A newer browser like Firefox, which does not support CSS shapes yet, gets the visual treatment in the middle, but once CSS shapes ships, it will automatically look like the design on the right. Current Chrome users see that now, because CSS shapes has been in Chrome for a while already.</p>
            <p>We do not have to go back and change our code every time the browser updates itself. In a way, it is now much safer than before to use cutting edge CSS in your projects, without having to worry that things will be broken on older browsers.</p>

          <blockquote>“CSS isn't a programming language. It's a stylesheet language. We shouldn't expect it to behave like a programming language. It has its own unique landscape and structures, ones that people with programming language mental maps might not expect.”<br><small>—Danielle Huntrods</small></blockquote>

            <p>Danielle Huntrods from Clearleft said it best. CSS has its own unique landscape and structures, and our mental maps around it need to reflect that.</p>
            <p>This is anecdotal, but my observation, based on a very limited sample size, is that it is often those who write the best back-end code, whose mental models around traditional programming paradigms are the strongest, who find CSS the most uncomfortable.</p>
            <p>When you think about CSS, think about water, and how it flows. We can learn to channel water to our benefit, or fight it and drown. Okay, maybe that was a little too dramatic, but you get my point, right?</p>

            <p>CSS is ultimately a holistic technology, in that, even though you can use properties in isolation, the full power of CSS shines through when used in combination. CSS is a team sport.</p>
            <p>For example, to do layout, we usually start off with using the <code>display</code> property. But eventually, most of us end up using a whole suite of properties that number more than players on a basketball team. These properties work together to make magic on the web.</p>

          <blockquote>“The hardest part is changing our thinking, not our CSS.”<br><small>—Jen Simmons</small></blockquote>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>We can always recreate the same old boring layouts that we've always built with these new powerful tools at our disposal. Or we can draw inspiration from graphic design and print magazines, from film, even architecture. These sources that inspire designs which, only a year before, I was saying could not be built. They couldn’t be built before, but they can be now.</p>
            <p>Some of you be thinking, why am I asking you to reinvent the wheel? Aren't we supposed to be building things faster, with less effort, ship ship ship! I don’t support that view. Here's my counter-question, is the wheel still relevant when you’re no longer on land? The web is a unique medium altogether. Maybe we ought to be thinking about wings instead.</p>
            <p>It’s not that I want things to take forever to build, but I still maintain a moderately romantic view of craftsmanship. Like the potter who works and shapes his clay by hand, like the sculptor who chisels his marble with the precision of a surgeon, I would like to direct my browser like a conductor does his orchestra.</p>

          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>To me, the magic of the web is the process by which the web evolves. The web was meant to be an open platform. One where new features can be proposed and discussed by the community before being implemented into browsers.</p>
            <p>And so, I want to encourage all of you to participate in shaping the web platform. You may think your voice is just a drop in the ocean, but it is not, it is significant. All the CSS working drafts are hosted on GitHub and we are free to raise issues for clarification or even submit pull requests if we spot any errors.</p>
            <p>Raising browser bugs sends a signal to browser vendors that certain features are in use, prompting them to fix those bugs sooner rather than later. Conversely, if we don't use a feature simply because it is buggy, browser vendors would think that feature is not in demand and prioritise something else instead.</p>
            <p>Writing and talking about certain CSS features provides visibility and feedback to browser vendors and specification writers as well. But regardless of platform, remember that browser engineers and specification writers are human too, and we all have feelings. So be kind, the world needs more kindness. And it is only through our collective effort, that we can make the web a better place for everyone.</p>
