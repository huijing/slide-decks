    <title>Vertical writing on the web: inadvertent layout inspiration from a search for cultural identity</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Modern CSS allows us to typeset for a dynamic medium, even for a language as complex as Chinese, with its tens of thousands of characters. And these same techniques can be extended to build layouts that were simply not feasible just a few years back. This talk aims to inspire designers and developers to eschew cookie-cutter web layouts and create designs that truly embrace the nature of the web.">

            <p>Hello everyone! I hope you all had a good lunch. Not too good, though. I wouldn't want you to fall into a food coma. But if you do doze off, I can only hope that you keep the snoring to a minimal volume.</p>
            <p>It has been an amazing conference thus far, hasn't it? With so many incredible speakers who have really expanded my horizons, and I feel blessed to be able to share the stage with all of them.</p>
            <p>The title of my talk is quite a mouthful, but it is a pretty good summary of what the next 40 minutes will entail. A bit about the web, a bit about culture, some writing and a dash of layout thrown in for good measure.</p>

              <p>Personally, I love the web. Last month, I read a book called “Weaving the Web”, which is the story of the World Wide Web, told by its creator, Sir Tim Berners-Lee. And he mentioned that there was no ‘Eureka’ moment, no ‘an-apple-hit-me-on-the-head’ kind of event, when it came to inventing the web.</p>
              <p>For him, inventing the World Wide Web involved a growing realisation that there was a power in arranging ideas in an unconstrained, web-like manner.</p>
              <p>Unlike computers, which are absolutely great at following step-by-step instructions, but fail terribly at making random associations, the human mind has a special ability to link random bits of information and connect seemingly unrelated ideas to generate new ones.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Many of the technical decisions around the web arose because of the key idea of universality, that one information space could encompass all the different documentation systems out there.</p>
              <p>We're talking about the ability to easily create a link from one document to another, across different organisations or institutions, without needing to merge databases or even have direct access to the other system. This was the premise the web was built upon.</p>

              <p>I didn't come from a rich family, but I was really lucky to have grown up with a computer in the house. Key functions of the computers from my childhood included, the 5.25 inch floppy drive, and the wonderfully clicky turbo button. I had no idea what it did at the time, but loved to press it anyway.</p>
              <p>And my first experience with the web sounded something like this. This is music to my ears. If you've never heard this before, well, you're obviously not from my generation. It blows my mind to think about how the web can connect people from opposite sides of the planet.</p>
              <p>Without the web, the odds of me being here are rather slim. Without the web, the chances of us ever crossing paths would be practically anorexic at best. And I would definitely not be standing up here, telling you this story about the web and reminiscing about my youth.</p>

              <p>I'm sure many people from America and Europe know exactly where Southeast Asia is. I mean, it's sort of self-explanatory, it's the South-Eastern section of Asia. But then again, I have also met people whose idea of Asia was limited to, China, India or Japan. Maybe they hadn't learned not to eat soggy waffles yet.</p>
              <p>Southeast Asia is made up of 11 countries, and every single one of them has their own distinct culture. English is taught in schools across the region, but we have so many other languages as well.</p>

              <p>Southeast Asia was heavily colonised by European powers starting from the 16th century, with Thailand being the only territory to avoid that fate. After the second World War, many colonies fought for their right to be independent sovereign states. Independence is always a struggle, like the Chinese saying 万事开头难, that states every beginning is difficult.</p>
              <p>As nascent countries, which were also ex-European colonies, there was an inevitable self-deprecation, a sentiment of Western superiority. It's a frame of mind that still lingers a little to this day. Because you cannot just declare independence and expect the culture and mindset of people who were occupied for generations to change overnight.</p>

            <h2>Do developers even care about typography?</h2>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>So here's another question, do developers even care about typography? When I was asked this, I thought it was a ridiculous question. In my mind, I was like, of course they do. But I'm wrong about a lot of things. So how many of you think typography is important?</p>
              <p>Typography has always been an integral part of Human-Computer Interaction and software design. Rendering text and graphics on an electronic screen is no easy task.</p>
              <p>If you really think about it, anything we see on a screen has everything to do with the field of computer graphics. And digital typography is really a cross-disciplinary field involving technical engineering, aesthetic design and mathematical precision.</p>

            <blockquote>“Typography is writing with prefabricated letters”<br><small>—Gerrit Noordzij</small></blockquote>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>There are many definitions of Typography out there, and the one I've settled on is by Gerrit Noordzij, that typography is writing with prefabricated letters. Letters are the building blocks of a writing system, regardless of language.</p>
              <p>There's probably a pretty diverse mix of languages spoken by the audience here today, and while a large number of those languages are alphabetic, Chinese is not one of them.</p>

          <section data-background-image="img/directions.jpg">
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Chinese is a logographic writing system, where each character is composed within a uniform square. This allows Chinese to be read efficiently, regardless of whether it is set horizontally or vertically.</p>
              <p>And until proven otherwise, it seems that the Chinese script developed separately from the Proto-Sinaitic scripts which were the origins of alphabetic languages.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Chinese typefaces are extremely challenging to create, simply due to the volume of glyphs required. The average number of glyphs for a Chinese system font clocks in at around 35,000 glyphs, give or take a couple thousand.</p>
              <p>You may have come across this article on Quartz that covers the process of creating a Chinese font. I saw it make the rounds on Twitter again earlier this year. It's an interesting read, and I'll share the link later, if anyone's interested.</p>
              <p>For a typeface to be viably used as body copy, it will probably need a minimum coverage of around 7000 glyphs for simplified Chinese or around 13,000 for traditional Chinese. That's still a lot of glyphs, hence Chinese fonts are almost always designed by teams over a period of years, not months.</p>

              <p>If you've ever used web fonts before, you would have seen these font formats. To understand how we got to this point, we need to go back a time a little bit. The earliest fonts were pixel-based bitmaps, which didn't work out so well when it came to high-resolution printing.</p>
              <p>A lot of smart people worked on this problem. And one of the solutions came from Adobe founder, John Warnock. He created Postscript in 1985, the very first vector font, and it really took off.</p>
              <p>TrueType was Apple and Microsoft's answer to Adobe's font monopoly. Microsoft came up with TrueType Open in 1994 and eventually Adobe joined in and together they developed OpenType.</p>
              <p>Microsoft also came up with EOT or embedded OpenType, a proprietary format for use on web pages. Although they tried to submit this as a W3C recommendation, it was rejected in favour of WOFF, or the Web Open Font Format. WOFF2 is an improvement over WOFF with significantly better compression rates.</p>

              <p>On the practical side of things, we use the <code>@font-face</code> rule to declare a list of different font formats in the hopes that our fonts will show up correctly in as many browsers as possible.

              <p>If either of them are absent, the entire <code>@font-face</code> rule is ignored. The <code>font-family</code> descriptor is simply a label that we reference in other CSS declarations. So even if you're using say, Frutiger, you could actually call it “Dumplings” and it would still work.</p>
              <p>The <code>src</code> descriptor is comma-separated list of external references or locally-installed font face names. It is made up of the declaration of the font file's location, and an optional format hint. If the browser doesn't support a particular font format stated in that hint, it won't bother loading the font at all.</p>

Technically, you could assign a black typeface to a font-weight of 100 and proceed to confuse your colleagues who cannot figure out why setting a weight of 100 gives them this massively bold typeface.

              <p>Sometimes the Latin characters for Chinese fonts don't look particularly nice, this is more apparent on older Windows systems, to be honest. So we can use the <code>unicode-range</code> descriptor to specify a specific font file to be loaded for individual code points or range of code points.</p>
              <p>In this example, I've created a font-family called Heiti Plus, which will use the Heiti SC font for everything, but the second rule tells the browser to use the Andika New Basic font for all Latin characters instead.</p>

              <p>But anyway, there's also the font panel that shows which fonts are loaded on your page. You can see that both Heiti SC and Andika New Basic are loaded for my custom font-family, Heiti Plus.</p>

            <aside class="notes">Chris Lilley, who chaired the group that developed @font-face, explained it really well in his dotCSS talk. That properties are requests for styling and descriptors are descriptions of capabilities. A <code>font-weight: bold;</code> within a <code>@font-face</code> rule means this font can do bold. While a <code>font-weight: bold;</code> applied as a property means style this element with a font that can do bold.</aside>

              <p>Font feature properties were introduced in Fonts Level 3. Modern font technologies allow fonts to contain a lot more glyphs that before. So we can utilise a variety of typographic features like swashes, ligatures, old-style numerals and so on.</p>
              <p>These features are part and parcel of good typography, which is necessary to hold your reader's attention. The written word is a transference of speech, which is heard, into something visual, to be seen. Good speakers will vary their cadence, use gestures, emphasise certain words.</p>
              <p>Typographic features like small caps, correct use of italics and punctuation do the same for text. Other features like old style numerals and ligatures help maintain typographic colour, to make reading more comfortable.</p>
              <p>So these are the features you can turn on via CSS, but note that the font you are using must have these features to begin with. This lot up there, are the features most often mentioned at web typography talks.</p>

              <p>Scarely anybody talks about <code>font-variant-east-asian</code>. What this property does is allow for glyph substitution and positioning in East Asian text. If you're unfamiliar with Han characters, it might seem like these languages share the same glyphs, but it depends. Han unification involves assigning the same code point to different glyphs, and it has been quite a controversial issue.</p>
              <p>We won't get into that, but the point is, the same code point can have variant glyphs depending on the language being used. Like, simplified Chinese glyphs versus traditional Chinese glyphs. Japanese glyphs have their own specification known as JIS or Japanese Industrial Standard, and they too have alternate glyphs for the same character. This property allows us to toggle these variant glyphs.</p>

              <p><code>font-feature-settings</code> allows us to toggle very specific OpenType properties. Last I checked, there were 141 OpenType feature tags to cover things like vertical kerning, unicase, scientific inferiors and so on.</p>
              <p>Browser support for each of <code>font-variant</code> properties varies at the moment, with Firefox being the only browser that has supported all of them since version 34.0.</p>
              <p><code>font-feature-settings</code>, on the other hand, has quite good support across most browsers. Although, the specification recommends to utilise the respective <code>font-variant</code> properties over the <code>font-feature-settings</code> property, until browser support becomes more robust, I suppose we'll continue to see <code>font-feature-settings</code> being used instead.</p>

              <p>Remember I mentioned OpenType earlier on? Well, in September 2016, version 1.8 of the specification introduced OpenType Font Variations. A joint development by Microsoft, Google, Apple and Adobe.</p>
              <p>An OpenType variable font is one in which the equivalent of multiple individual fonts can be compactly packaged within a single font file, which can potentially be a big plus when it comes to performance. This is especially significant for fonts with large glyph sets, like CJK fonts.</p>
              <p>In addition to that, the dynamism of variable fonts makes it perfect for the web medium, and opens up the possibility of new kinds of responsive typography.</p>

              <p>Because variable fonts are so new, the W3C are still working on drafting out how variation axis values should be controlled via CSS in the Fonts Level 4 specification.</p>
              <p>Currently, there are 5 common axes of variation that can be enabled by via the <code>font-size</code>, <code>font-weight</code>, <code>font-stretch</code> and <code>font-style</code> properties. There is also one new property defined in the specification for optical sizing. But as new variation axes become popular, more properties will be added to control those axes in future.</p>

              <p>No browser supports the digits value yet, which allows us to dictate how many digits are acceptable to be squeezed in. The range allowed is between 2 to 4 characters. For now, with the <code>all</code> value, there is no limit, so you could technically put hippopotamus in there and it will just look horribly squished.</p>

              <p>When I started this talk, I mentioned how I had assumed the digital world was always going to be left-to-right when I was a kid. And I had carried that assumption for quite a while. Even when Chinese language support on my PC and the web got much better, I never really thought about the layout part of things.</p>
              <p>It wasn't until a couple years back when I was in a crowded subway train, peeking over the shoulder of this guy reading a Chinese novel on his phone, that I started to think, hey, a vertical layout seems like it would work really well here. I wonder if it's possible to do that on the web...?</p>
              <p>So that's how I fell into this rabbit hole of vertical typesetting on the web, and learning a lot more about the Chinese language. And as you can see from this demo, the answer to my original question is a resounding yes, with all 3 properties I covered earlier being showcased here.</p>

              <p>It was quite tricky to get the images to orientate correctly. It would have been nice to have a media query for writing modes so I could layout my images accordingly with the picture element, but that doesn't exist yet so I ended up working around the image issue with CSS transforms instead.</p>

The Chinese Layout Task Force, which I am a part of, aims to document requirements for the layout and presentation of text for the major languages of China when they are used by Web standards, like Hanzi, Mongolian, Tibetan and Uighur scripts.</aside>

              <p>For example, you can make a bookshelf style list of posts with just CSS. Something like this can be done by applying a <code>vertical-rl</code> to each list item, with some padding and inset box-shadows thrown in for the visual effect.</p>
              <p>Or we could do headers. Normally we wouldn't think of laying out long chunks of text vertically for typical Latin-based left-to-right languages. But using vertical text for short titles or headers can break up the monotony of a long page.</p>

            <aside class="notes">If you're working with a language meant to be read horizontally from top to bottom, then vertical text should largely be decorative. We don't want to compromise the reading experience for long form passages. So at smaller screens, we can make use of media queries to revert to a horizontal layout that makes better use of the limited space.</aside>

              <p>On the other hand, there are instances where text rotated vertically can work on narrow screen sizes as well. Like Joe explained yesterday, the hamburger menu is not a design axiom.</p>
              <p>Depending on the number of links in your navigation, laying them out vertically along the side edge could be a design worth considering. And I'm sure many of you can come up with even more interesting designs that utilise vertical layouts.</p>

When I started building vertical layouts, Grid hadn't landed yet, so I used Flexbox for a lot of the layout. Flexbox support is great, I mean, it has wider coverage than <code>border-radius</code>, but Flexbox with <code>writing-mode</code>? Not so good. I'll be honest, there are quite a number of cross browser issues.</aside>

              <p>But that doesn't mean we should just shy away from using vertical text altogether. In fact, there's never been a better time than now to live on the cutting edge. Evergreen browsers are a thing now, with bug fixes and new features being shipped faster than ever.</p>
              <p>And here's a little something I learned along the way. By raising bugs we find when trying out new features, we are actually telling browser vendors that these features are in demand.</p>
              <p>Conversely, if we don't use features simply because they are buggy, browser vendors will think that nobody really cares about that feature and focus on something else instead. Because we all have to prioritise.</p>
              <p>Raising bugs will probably gain you karma points and helps make the web better for all of us.</p>

            <p>If you need inspiration for vertical layouts, the Tateyoko Web Awards site has a really nice list. While Jen Simmons has an experimental layout lab where she showcases all the different things that are now possible with modern CSS.</p>
            <p>The thing about attending conferences, at least for me, is not so much to gain expertise overnight, but rather to get inspired. To learn of things that I did not know existed, to discover something new and perhaps gain insights and hear perspectives that never occurred to me before.</p>
            <p>All these techniques I mentioned may or may not be relevant to you right now, and that's perfectly fine. But I do hope that you keep them at the back of your mind, so that one day, when the time comes, you can reach for them and create something extraordinary.</p>
