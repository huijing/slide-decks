# Building layouts the way the web intended

*For JS fwdays conference 2022. This is a sort-of transcript plus my notes for the talk.*

добрий день!

I'm very honoured to be part of the line-up of JS fwdays this year, and I understand that this is a JS+React conference, so think of me not as the main course, but as a palate cleanser, a little something to refresh and activate a slightly different part of your brain.

Today, I will be sharing with you about laying out content on the web. And honestly, regardless of which technology stack you're using, odds are you will need to render and display content on a digital screen. And that screen could be any size these days.

If your content is going to be rendered by a browser engine, then your main mode of communication with the browser for styling content has to be CSS. And I'm sure everyone today has their own opinion about CSS, some of you might love it as much as I do, while others might see of it as a hard-to-deal with API you would like to avoid as much as possible.

Regardless of your opinions on CSS, I'm not here to tell you what to think or how to feel. The reality is that browser engines today are much more capable than before, they can lay out content much better than before. And we need to know how to make full use of the browser's web layout capabilities.
