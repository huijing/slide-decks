          <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
          <p>This talk is purely a sharing based off my personal experiences and I do not believe this represents the full picture of the situation in my region.</p>
          <p>I am also by no means an expert on accessibility but I am trying my best to learn and get better at it.</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>To be honest, I'm fairly nervous about this talk, because not only is it a completely new talk I've never given before. But it is also about a topic that I'm nowhere as confident in my knowledge as compared to something like CSS or basketball.</p>
            <p>I'm fairly certain there are folks in the audience who are way better at this than I am, and if there is anything I mention that you think is not correct, please let me know, I really want to get better at this.</p>

            <p>There are a number of numeronyms relevant to the web, like i18n, for example, but I like the one for accessibility because it also looks like the word ‚Äúally‚Äù, which is just so apt, in my opinion.</p>
            <p>My understanding of web accessibility is to make your websites or web applications usable by as many people as possible.</p>
            <p>There is that inevitable association of accessibility as relevant only for folks with disabilities but it's much broader than that. I know from personal experience that all of us are simply temporarily abled.</p>
            <p>You could fall ill or be injured. You could just happen to carrying something with one hand and trying to use your phone on the other. You might end up in a place with a bad connection. All of these circumstances should not block you from accessing information.</p>

          <h2>Why isn't accessibility explicitly taught during the basics of web development? ü§î</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>I am a self-taught web developer. And the way I learned was through various free online courses like CodeAcademy and the like, plus a lot of trial and error. I started out copying and pasting code by viewing source, not even knowing what half the code did.</p>
            <p>Even though I've read countless articles and heard from many experienced folks on different web development topics over the course of my career, I noticed accessibility made up a relatively small proportion of my daily consumption.</p>
            <p>Thinking back on those online courses that I took, I can scarcely remember much mention of accessibility, and I do wonder why that is?</p>

          <h2>The 80-20 rule</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The 80-20 rule is also known as the Pareto principle, which states that for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.</p>
            <p>What does this have to do with accessibility, you may be wondering? This ties back to my previous thought on why accessibility part of the standard learn to web curriculum because there are numerous low-hanging fruit level things we do for all our projects.</p>
            <p>And if we take care of these things throughout the course of the project, instead of as one big scary accessibility task, I truly believe that you'd barely feel the weight of any extra effort at all.</p>
            <p>Some of these things may sound like no-brainers, but I've encountered numerous projects that miss out these things, to an extent that it feels more like the norm to miss them out.</p>

            <p>This is some information on web accessibility laws in Asia I managed to dig up, most of it is from the W3C site directly but if you notice, they are mostly recommendations or guidelines. The only scope where accessibility is mandatory is for government sites.</p>
            <p>So I don't think it's a surprise when a lot of folks here don't see accessibility as something important. And based on my personal experience working for local companies, management tends to be fairly top-down, and quite often the emphasis is on short-term results.</p>
            <p>I'm not saying that all local companies ignore accessibility, but I do feel the lack of legislative consequence does have an impact on how organisations perceive its importance.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>I do want to stress the importance of using your best judgement on the content you're trying to present. If you're planning to use an animated 3D stacked pie chart, consider including an accessible data table that can express the same thing.</p>
            <p>But if you're trying to present say a 3D CSS art work collection, then it doesn't make sense to insist every art piece is perfectly accessible to visually impaired folks since the medium is completely visual.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Depending on the type of environment you're in, I would say there are different levels of what you can do, how much you can push back on certain things and so on.</p>
            <p>So let's start from the stuff that you almost definitely can get away with. I know it's slightly depressing that I'm framing accessibility in this manner, but I accept my reality and I'm merely sharing my thoughts based on that.</p>

            <p>I consider actions you can take on an individual capacity and are relatively low effort, things you can get away with, like page titles. Okay, maybe this wasn't the best first example, and page titles are important for SEO as well.</p>
            <p>I don't actually recall seeing any websites without A page title, probably because I wouldn't have found it on Google at all. But I have encountered pages that don't have proper page titles when navigating within the site. Like, the page title remains unchanged as the site name or something.</p>
            <p>So this is definitely something to check, because it is easily missed out. The best practice is to front-load important information first.</p>
            <p>I don't think people intentionally miss this out, but with hardly anyone writing meta tags by hand anymore, this is sort of a common issue, especially when we forget to setup our templates properly.</p>

            <p>I personally took a while before I got the hang of this. I would love to say that I knew about best practices from day 1 that is clearly a bold-faced lie. No, no, no, I've done terrible things. Like setting the alt text to ‚Äúimage3Ã¶‚Äù. I have since been trying to redeem myself.</p>
            <p>All jokes aside, this is really a bit of an art rather than a strict science. And the examples from the W3C as well as WebAIM really helped me grasp the guidelines. First of all, every image must have the alt attribute, even if its empty, it must be there.</p>
            <p>How the alt text is written does depend on the context in which the image appears and the intended content of the image.</p>

          <aside class="notes">Option 4 would likely be the best alternative text in this instance. Option 1 unnecessarily describes the image as an image. Option 2 provides extra information that is not presented directly in the image and it is also redundant with content presented later within the text. Option 3 (no alt attribute) is not appropriate because the image conveys content that is not directly presented in the surrounding context. Even though the surrounding text does indicate that it's referring to Viola the red panda, visual users can tell this directly from the content of the image - so if the image conveys content, it should be given alternative text.</aside>

            <p>Standard HTML controls for user interface elements already meet basic WCAG success criterion when used according to specification. Browsers have a lot of accessibility features built in, the work has already been done for you. All you need to do is use the appropriate element.</p>
            <p>There are semantic elements for lots of things, from addresses to keyboard inputs to maps and time. My suggestion is, before you create that next div, think about the content you want to put in it, and check if there's a semantic element for that.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>A fairly good check of when you want to use a button and when you want to use a link is to ask, what happens when your user clicks? If the click triggers an action, go for a button. If the click brings them to somewhere else, go for a link.</p>
            <p>This distinction can have major implications for usability. Links must have a non-empty href attribute for keyboard users to access them. But the biggest problem is when developers create links that go nowhere.</p>
            <p>For example, drop-down menus that activate on hover only. Easier to show on CodePen.</p>
            <p>And besides, as developers, we have the power of CSS to let us style either element however we like. I recommend this very comprehensive article on links and buttons from CSS tricks.</p>

            <p>Sharing another personal anecdote here, a very extreme case imo, so not sure if anyone can relate, but I've seen code that went through a whole lot of trouble trying to recreate the behaviour of a text input on an empty div element.</p>
            <p>Even though my first thought was, wow, this person doesn't know the input element exists, the amount of code written made me aware of how much the browser takes care of already as long as we do the minimal effort of using semantic elements.</p>

            <p>If you are in an environment where you can make content/design decisions autonomously, that's great. But I find it is more common to have full-time designers and sometimes content writers you work with.</p>
            <p>All the previous tips were almost visually invisible, but things like colour contrast, text sizes, form labels and so on are probably things you would want to discuss with the designers on your team.</p>
            <p>If your designers are not familiar with how browsers work, I really believe that the time and patience developers take to explain reasons why a certain design might not be the best idea is worth it.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>For a while I had been told not to use fixed font sizes because it would break zoom on browsers. But I noticed that even when I set a fixed font size trying to zoom with the browser still grew my text as expected.</p>
            <p>Browsers implemented something called proportional scaling years ago, and the simplistic explanation is that it makes CSS pixels larger, hence the viewport smaller allowing media queries to trigger.</p>
            <p>But there is also something called text scaling, which only works on websites that define font sizes and maybe some other elements with relative units, like rems.</p>
            <p>Users have the option to set their default font size from the browser settings, so it is still a good idea to size things with relative units to respect your user's default choices.</p>

            <p>It's fairly common to have customised link styles and hover styles but there are still a couple of things to note. Related to the previous point about colour, it would be better to have something extra like an underline to indicate the presence of a link.</p>
            <p>This is why I suggest developing a good working relationship with your designers and constantly keep them updated about browser behaviours, what is possible with new CSS and so on. And take the opportunity to slowly share your knowledge about accessibility.</p>

            <p>The outline property and the border property are fairly similar except that outlines never take up space, since they are drawn outside the element's content. And they don't necessarily have to be rectangular, but they almost always are.</p>
