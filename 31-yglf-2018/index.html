    <title>East Asian web typography: crossing cultural boundaries for web layout inspiration</title>
    <meta name="description" content="This talk traces the parallel history of western and eastern typography from handwriting to the internet age, setting the context for how the web is a brand new medium for typesetting. CSS allows us to implement advanced typographic features and multi-directional layouts, that not only benefits internationalisation, but opens up a myriad of options for creative and interesting layouts in general as well.">

            <p>добрий день (do-bry den)! This is my first time in Ukraine and I've been here for a couple of days. I must say, Kyiv is a stunningly beautiful city. Today, I'm going to talking about a number of things. Starting with a bit of typography, then about web fonts, followed by how East Asian typography and modern CSS can inspire web layouts that are different from the standard 12-column grid designs that we see almost everywhere.</p>
            <p>I'm going to assume almost everyone here speaks Ukrainian and English. Does anybody here speak Chinese?</p>

            <p>So a little bit about myself. My first name is Hui Jing, and my family name is Chen. I really love emojis, and as of today, we have 2,666 emojis to choose from. It's totally possible to describe myself with emojis.</p>
            <p>I am from Malaysia and I played basketball for more than half my life, and it was what kick-started my web career. I'm a front-end engineer who loves CSS, so I sometimes write blog posts about CSS and web design. I'm also a Mozilla Techspeaker, which is an initiative by Mozilla to support technical evangelists in local communities across the world by providing resources and funding.</p>

              <p>What do you think about when you hear the word typography? Typography might sound like something only artsy, creative types care about. But these days, it seems that typography is catching the attention of mainstream news.</p>
              <p>We have big brand names, like Netflix and National Geographic, talking extensively about their font redesigns, there was even that Supreme Court case in Pakistan where the Microsoft font, Calibri, was the crucial piece of evidence that proved the forgery of financial documents. How cool is that?</p>

            <h2>What is typography?</h2>
            <blockquote class="fragment">“Typography is writing with prefabricated letters”<br><small>—Gerrit Noordzij</small></blockquote>
            <aside class="notes">So what is typography? There are plenty of definitions out there, but I've settled on this one by Gerrit Noordzij, that typography is writing with prefabricated letters. Letters are a type of grapheme, which is the smallest unit of a writing system of any given language.</aside>

              <p>Writing systems are visual representations of verbal communication. A means to record whatever we say, in our respective languages, for storage and transfer. Like an external memory bank.</p>
              <p>The world is very diverse when it comes to language and culture, so it's only natural that there are many different writing systems used all over the planet. A majority of the world use writing systems that consist of alphabets.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Chinese typefaces are extremely challenging to create, simply due to the volume of glyphs required. The average number of glyphs for a Chinese system font clocks in at around 35,000 glyphs, give or take a couple thousand.</p>
              <p>This quote is from an article on Quartz that covered the process of creating a Chinese font, and it's a pretty interesting read, which goes into how much effort is needed to design and create a Chinese typeface.</p>
              <p>For a typeface to be viably used as body copy, it will probably need a minimum coverage of around 7000 glyphs for simplified Chinese or around 13,000 for traditional Chinese. That's still a lot of glyphs, hence Chinese fonts are almost always designed by teams over a period of years.</p>

              <p>If you've ever used web fonts before, you would have seen these font formats. To understand why we have so many of them, we need to go back a time a little bit. The earliest fonts were pixel-based bitmaps, which didn't work out so well when it came to high-resolution printing.</p>
              <p>A lot of smart people worked on this problem. And one of the solutions came from Adobe founder, John Warnock. He created Postscript in 1985, the very first vector font, and it really took off.</p>
              <p>TrueType was Apple and Microsoft's answer to Adobe's font monopoly. Microsoft came up with TrueType Open in 1994 and eventually Adobe joined in and together they developed OpenType.</p>
              <p>Microsoft also came up with EOT or embedded OpenType, a proprietary format for use on web pages. Although they tried to submit this as a W3C recommendation, it was rejected in favour of WOFF, or the Web Open Font Format. WOFF2 is an improvement over WOFF with significantly better compression rates.</p>

              <p>On the practical side of things, we use the <code>@font-face</code> rule to declare a list of different font formats in the hopes that our fonts will show up correctly in as many browsers as possible. Nowadays, it's safe enough to declare just WOFF and WOFF2.</p>
              <p>The <code>@font-face</code> rule has many descriptors but only <code>font-family</code> and <code>src</code>, are mandatory.</p>
              <p>If either of them are absent, the entire <code>@font-face</code> rule block is ignored. The <code>font-family</code> descriptor is simply a label that we reference in other CSS declarations. So maybe you're using Helvetica, you don't have to put “Helvetica” as the descriptor, вареники (va-re-ny-ky) would work just fine.</p>
              <p>The <code>src</code> descriptor tells the browser where to find the font file, it could be an external reference, or a locally installed font. It also includes an optional format hint. If the browser doesn't support a particular font format stated in that hint, it won't bother loading the font at all.</p>

              <p>Then we have the <code>unicode-range</code> descriptor. which allows us to create composite fonts that mix glyphs from different fonts for different scripts.</p>
              <p>For example, this presentation uses the font Infini, which unfortunately does not support Cyrillic letters. So I used the <code>unicode-range</code> descriptor to tell my browser to load the Linux Biolinum font when it encounters any Cyrillic characters.</p>
              <p>Remember that for font-face rules, the font-family is simply a label, so what I've done here is created a composite font that uses the name Infini, but in actuality, loads 2 different font files depending on what characters need to be displayed.</p>

              <p>If a page does not contain any Cyrillic characters, Biolinum won't be loaded at all because it is not needed. Same goes for any pages that don't contain Chinese characters, then Ping Fang won't be loaded either.</p>
              <p>All these font descriptors I've talked about thus far look very similar to CSS properties, but they are 2 completely different things.</p>

That properties are requests for styling and descriptors are descriptions of capabilities. A <code>font-weight: bold;</code> within a <code>@font-face</code> rule means this font can do bold. While a <code>font-weight: bold;</code> applied as a property means style this element with a font that can do bold.</aside>

              <p>CSS font properties are our typesetting tools for the web. When you use them in your CSS declarations, imagine that you're running your own printing workshop.

              <p>Your apprentice then runs off to the back room, where all the fonts are kept, and tries to find the font that best matches your instructions based on their descriptors, which were assigned in the @font-face rule.</p>
              <p>I believe most people have used the first 3 or 4 on this list in your stylesheets. And Lea already covered how they have been updated to take extra values for variable fonts, as well as <code>font-display</code> earlier. So I'm going to talk a bit about the last 2.</p>

              <p>Now, your smart apprentice can sometimes be too well-meaning. Sometimes the true italic or heavier version of a font does not exist, so the browser will try to create that effect by itself, based on a regular font. Lea also showed us an example of how it doesn't turn out very nicely.</p>
              <p>In fact, most Chinese fonts don't have italic variants. We can set the <code>font-synthesis</code> property to a value of <code>none</code>, to tell the browser to just leave the font alone.</p>

              <p>Font feature properties were introduced in Fonts Level 3. Modern font technologies allow fonts to contain a lot more glyphs that before. So we can utilise a variety of typographic features like swashes, ligatures, old-style numerals and so on.</p>
              <p>These features are part and parcel of good typography, which is necessary to hold your reader's attention. The written word is a transference of speech, which is heard, into something visual, to be seen. Good speakers will vary their cadence, use gestures, emphasise certain words.</p>
              <p>Typographic features like small caps, correct use of italics and punctuation do the same for text. Other features like old style numerals and ligatures help maintain typographic colour, to make reading more comfortable.</p>
              <p>We can turn these features on or off with CSS, but note that the font you are using must have these features to begin with. This lot up there, are the features most often mentioned at web typography talks.</p>

              <p>Hardly anybody talks about <code>font-variant-east-asian</code>. What this property does is allow for glyph substitution and positioning in East Asian text. If you're unfamiliar with Han characters, it might seem like these languages share the same glyphs, but it depends. Han unification involves assigning the same code point to different glyphs, and it has been quite a controversial issue.</p>
              <p>We won't get into that, but the point is, the same code point can have variant glyphs depending on the language being used. Like, simplified Chinese glyphs versus traditional Chinese glyphs. Japanese glyphs too can have alternate glyphs for the same character, and this property allows us to toggle these variant glyphs.</p>

              <p>An OpenType variable font is one in which the equivalent of multiple individual fonts can be compactly packaged within a single font file, which can potentially be a big plus when it comes to performance. This is especially significant for fonts with large glyph sets, like CJK fonts.</p>
              <p>In addition to that, the dynamism of variable fonts makes it perfect for the web medium, and opens up the possibility of new kinds of responsive typography.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Laying out content in a different direction does require a change in perspective. And I gleaned quite a few insights from working with vertical layout. For example, the techniques I was so used to for centring items worked a bit differently with a vertical layout.</p>
              <p>To vertically centre a block, setting the top and bottom margins to <code>auto</code> actually does work, unlike in horizontal writing, which is great. But trying to centre something horizontally is an exercise in pain.</p>

              <p style="font-size:75%;text-align:left;height:75vh">A vital part of New York’s avant-garde art scene from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, Yayoi Kusama developed a distinctive style utilizing approaches associated with Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism, Pop art, Feminist art, and Institutional Critique—but she always defined herself in her own terms. “I am an obsessional artist,” she once said. “People may call me otherwise, but…I consider myself a heretic of the art world.”</p>
              <p style="font-size:75%;text-align:left;height:75vh">Kusama was born in 1929 into a well-off but dysfunctional family in Nagano, Japan. Largely shielded from the horrors of World War II, she was, as she has claimed, nevertheless scarred by her mother’s cruelty, her father’s infidelities, and her family’s discouragement of her interest in art making. She started painting at the age of 10 when she began experiencing the visual and aural hallucinations that would plague her, while also fueling her creativity, for the rest of her life. She has maintained that her “artwork is an expression of my life, particularly of my mental disease.”</p>

              <p>So a few years ago, I was in a crowded train and noticed a guy standing in front of me reading a Chinese novel on his phone, but it was laid out horizontal, top-to-bottom. And I thought to myself, a vertical layout would work really well for reading Chinese on a phone. Can we do that on the web?</p>
              <p>So that's how I fell into this rabbit hole of vertical typesetting on the web, and learning a lot more about the Chinese language. And as you can see from this demo, the answer to that question is a resounding yes, with all 3 properties I covered earlier being showcased here.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Once I figured out vertical layouts were possible, the next logical step was to have a toggle that allowed readers to switch between vertical and horizontal layouts. You know, because we can do that for Chinese.</p>
              <p>It was quite tricky to get the images to orientate correctly. It would have been nice to have a media query for writing modes so I could layout my images accordingly with the picture element, but that doesn't exist yet so I ended up working around the image issue with CSS transforms instead.</p>

              <p>For example, you can make a bookshelf style list of posts with just CSS. Something like this can be done by applying a <code>vertical-rl</code> to each list item, with some padding and inset box-shadows thrown in for the visual effect.</p>
              <p>Or we could do headers. Normally we wouldn't think of laying out long chunks of text vertically for typical Latin-based left-to-right languages. But using vertical text for short titles or headers can break up the monotony of a long page.</p>

              <p>But that doesn't mean we should just shy away from using vertical text altogether. In fact, there's never been a better time than now to live on the cutting edge. Evergreen browsers are a thing now, with bug fixes and new features being shipped faster than ever.</p>
              <p>And here's a little something I learned along the way. By raising bugs we find when trying out new features, we are actually telling browser vendors that these features are in demand.</p>
              <p>Conversely, if we don't use features simply because they are buggy, browser vendors will think that nobody really cares about that feature and focus on something else instead. Because we all have to prioritise.</p>
              <p>Raising bugs will probably gain you karma points and helps make the web better for all of us.</p>
