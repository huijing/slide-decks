# Working with CSS doesnâ€™t have to make you cry

_For Letterform Lectures. This is a sort-of transcript plus my notes for the talk._

Hello everyone! Thank you all for being here today. I've been a member of the Letterform Archive since 2018 and I think I managed to visit once back then. So having this opportunity to present a Letterform Lecture is pretty mind-blowing to me.

As you can see from the title, this talk is probably slightly different from the other Letterform Lectures in that it leans a little more toward technology than design. More similar to the excellent "A Byte Sized History of Computer Typography" with Ben Zotto back in February, do watch it if you haven't.

My name is Hui Jing. It's a Chinese name, so our family name comes first. And these are my representative emojis, if you will. I've been gainfully employed as a web developer for more than a decade. Given how fast things move on the web, it's like watching a very sped-up time-lapse video. So we will start off with a little bit of history, just to build up more context on how we got to where we are now.
